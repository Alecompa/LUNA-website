## Overview

The $^{22}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$Na reaction is a critical component of the **NeNa cycle**, which operates during hydrogen burning in evolved stars and explosive environments like novae.

This reaction affects the abundances of neon and sodium isotopes, which are key observables in Globular Cluster stars showing the characteristic Na-O anticorrelation.

## Scientific Motivation

### Globular Cluster Puzzle
Spectroscopic observations reveal unexplained abundance patterns in Globular Clusters, with some stars showing enhanced sodium and depleted oxygen. The NeNa cycle is believed to be responsible for these patterns.

### ONe Novae
In oxygen-neon (ONe) novae, the $^{22}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$Na reaction competes with $^{22}$Ne(p,$\alpha$)$^{19}$F, determining the final abundance ratios observed in nova ejecta.

## Experimental Campaign

The LUNA measurement campaign focused on:

1. **Resonance strengths** at astrophysically relevant energies
2. **Direct capture contribution** at low energies
3. **Interference effects** between resonances
4. **Temperature-dependent reaction rates**

## Methodology

- **Implanted neon targets** on tantalum backings with high isotopic enrichment
- **BGO summing detector** for high detection efficiency
- **Complementary HPGe detector** for detailed spectroscopy
- **Extended energy range** from threshold to above the Gamow window

## Key Findings

The experiment successfully:
- Measured several previously unmeasured resonances
- Improved uncertainties on key resonance strengths by factors of 2-10
- Provided first direct constraints on the direct capture component
- Resolved discrepancies in previous measurements

## Impact on Stellar Models

These results led to:
- **30% reduction** in reaction rate uncertainties for AGB stars
- Improved predictions of Na/O ratios in Globular Cluster stars
- Better understanding of nova nucleosynthesis
- Constraints on hot-bottom burning in AGB stars

## Publications

The comprehensive results were published in *Physical Review C* and *The Astrophysical Journal*, becoming standard references for NeNa cycle modeling.

## Follow-up Work

This measurement enabled and inspired:
- Improved theoretical calculations of the reaction mechanism
- Further studies of the competing (p,Î±) channel
- Application to Galactic chemical evolution models
- Planning for measurements of other NeNa cycle reactions
