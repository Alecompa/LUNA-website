## Overview

The $^{19}$F(p,$\gamma$)$^{20}$Ne reaction plays a key role in the nucleosynthesis of fluorine in stellar environments, particularly in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and novae.

Accurate cross-section data at astrophysically relevant energies are essential to understand the depletion of fluorine and the operation of the CNO cycles in stellar interiors.

## Motivation

Recent measurements at JUNA have provided new insights, but additional data at lower energies are necessary to reduce uncertainties in stellar models.

The LUNA measurement aims to extend the cross-section data to even lower energies within the **Gamow window** relevant for hydrogen burning in stars.

## Scientific Goals

- Improve constraints on the reaction rate
- Test theoretical models, particularly those involving direct capture
- Investigate low-energy resonances suggested by recent experiments
- Understand fluorine abundance patterns in stellar spectra

## Experimental Setup

The experiment is being conducted at the **LUNA 400 kV accelerator** located deep underground in the Gran Sasso Laboratory, benefiting from extremely low background conditions.

### Key Components

1. **High-efficiency BGO detector**: Captures the full Î³-ray cascade following the $^{19}$F(p,$\gamma$)$^{20}$Ne reaction
2. **Fluorine-rich target**: Maintained under ultra-high vacuum conditions
3. **Proton beams**: Delivered at energies approaching the stellar Gamow window

## Underground Advantage

The deep underground location provides:
- Reduced cosmic ray background
- Enhanced sensitivity at low cross sections
- Ability to measure closer to stellar energies
- Cleaner gamma-ray spectra

## Expected Impact

This measurement will:
- Refine fluorine abundance predictions in AGB stars
- Improve nova nucleosynthesis models
- Constrain CNO cycle operation in various stellar environments
- Test nuclear structure models at low energies
