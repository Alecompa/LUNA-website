## Overview

The $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is one of the most important reactions for nuclear astrophysics. It is the main neutron source for the weak s-process, which is responsible for the creation of elements in the mass range 50 < A < 90.

In addition it provides a secondary neutron burst during the later stages of the main s-process, modifying the abundances around the so-called "branch points" of s-process nucleosynthesis, which are important markers for the astrophysical conditions during this phase.

## Astrophysical Significance

Together with its competitor channel $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{25}$Mg, this reaction directly impacts the abundances of the Mg isotopes, which can be directly observed in stellar atmospheres.

The reaction has a negative Q-value and only starts to operate at energies above ca. 600 keV, which lies in the energy range of interest for stellar nucleosynthesis scenarios.

## Challenges

The cross section needs to be known from the neutron threshold up to and including a strong resonance at 832 keV, which is the only resonance measured so far in this range. From indirect data we know of the existence of a number of positive parity states below this resonance, but their strengths are not well constrained by nuclear data, leading to massive uncertainties in nucleosynthesis predictions.

## Experimental Approach

The goal of the underground measurement of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg is the first determination of resonance strengths in the astrophysically important energy range and the remeasurement of the 832 keV resonance.

### Key Features

- **Novel hybrid neutron detector array** with relatively high efficiency while keeping energy sensitivity
- **High-intensity alpha beam** from the new MV accelerator at the Bellotti IBF
- **Recirculating gas target** of > 99.99% enriched $^{22}$Ne
- **Deep underground location** providing drastic reduction of natural neutron background

## Sensitivity

By combining all these advantages, we will achieve a sensitivity increase by over **two orders of magnitude** over the state of the art, aiming at discovery measurement of so far unseen low energy resonances.

## Funding

This experiment is being carried out in the framework of the **ERC Starting Grant SHADES** (grant no. 852016).
