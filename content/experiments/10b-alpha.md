## Overview

The study of the $^{10}$B+$\alpha$ reactions is of significant astrophysical interest as a potential alternative pathway for the synthesis of elements in the CNO mass region, particularly in the context of first-generation (Population III) stars.

In these early stellar environments, conventional CNO nucleosynthesis may be suppressed due to the absence of initial seed nuclei, and reactions involving light elements like boron could play a crucial role.

## Research Goals

At the LUNA underground laboratory, we aim to investigate three reaction channels at the low energies relevant to stellar interiors:

1. $^{10}$B($\alpha$,p)
2. $^{10}$B($\alpha$,d)
3. $^{10}$B($\alpha$,n)$^{13}$N

## Experimental Techniques

### Charged Particle Detection
Charged particle detection will be used to study the ($\alpha$,p) and ($\alpha$,d) channels.

### Activation Technique
The ($\alpha$,n)$^{13}$N reaction will be probed via an activation technique, exploiting the β+ decay of $^{13}$N (half-life ≈ 10 minutes), which produces 511 keV annihilation gamma rays. These will be detected in coincidence by opposing crystals of a **BGO detector array**, enhancing sensitivity.

### Direct Neutron Detection
To extend measurements to even lower energies, where activation becomes challenging, we will also explore direct neutron detection using **deuterated liquid scintillators**.

## Scientific Impact

These studies will provide valuable constraints on:
- Nucleosynthesis pathways in the early universe
- Chemical evolution driven by the first stars
- Alternative CNO cycle initiation mechanisms
- Population III stellar models

## ERC NUCLEAR Project

These studies form part of the **ERC Advanced Grant NUCLEAR**: *NUclear CLustering Effects in Astrophysical Reactions: Nucleosynthesis in First Stars and Other Puzzles*
