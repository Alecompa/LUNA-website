## Overview

The $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction is fundamental to several critical astrophysical processes. In stars with masses greater than 8 solar masses, carbon burning occurs after the exhaustion of hydrogen and helium. This reaction plays a key role in shaping the star's core structure and energy production, determining its evolutionary path toward later stages like supernovae.

## Astrophysical Applications

### Type Ia Supernovae
The $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction is critical in the ignition of Type Ia supernovae, particularly in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, where it triggers a thermonuclear runaway that results in the explosion of the white dwarf.

### Type II Supernovae
In Type II supernovae, carbon fusion also plays a role in the advanced stages of carbon burning in massive stars, contributing to the nucleosynthesis that leads to the star's collapse and explosive death.

### Neutron Star Accretion
In neutron star accretion disks, superbursts (intense, rapid outbursts) are thought to be ignited by carbon fusion. Understanding this reaction is key to understanding the physics behind these extreme events, including the ignition depth.

### CNO Revival
At very high temperatures, the products of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction can be responsible for a high-temperature revival of hydrogen and helium burning. This process is important in the advanced stages of stellar evolution and can influence the production of heavier elements.

## The Challenge

However, the cross section of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction is very difficult to measure and the thermonuclear reaction rate is still very uncertain. Accurate, direct measurements of the cross-section, especially at low energies, are crucial for resolving the long-standing uncertainties surrounding this reaction.

## LUNA Measurement

LUNA is conducting a direct measurement of this reaction deep underground at the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility. This study focuses on the detection of photons emitted in the de-excitation of Ne and Na populated via the two key reaction channels:

- $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$\alpha$)$^{20}$Ne
- $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,p)$^{23}$Na

## Experimental Setup

The experimental setup includes:

1. **Massive shielding**: ~13 tons of lead and copper with a sliding door
2. **HPGe detector**: Very sensitive High Purity Germanium detector
3. **Retractable beamline**: Allows for flexible experimental configurations
4. **Advanced target**: Synthesized graphite target on water-cooled aluminum holder produced via additive manufacturing

### Background Reduction

- The **Gran Sasso rock** significantly reduces cosmic-ray-induced muons, resulting in a clean high-energy region in gamma spectra
- The **lead and copper shielding** effectively suppresses low-energy background from natural radioactivity
- This combination ensures a clearer signal for the experiment

## Future Upgrade

In a few months, a new component will be installed to achieve even higher sensitivity:

A **segmented 16-fold NaI detector** with large angular coverage will be placed around the target and the HPGe detector. It will serve dual purposes:
- Active anti-Compton shield
- Total absorption calorimeter

## Groundbreaking Goal

The unique setup and the special features of the Bellotti IBF position the LUNA experiment to make the **first-ever direct measurement** of the C+C reaction in the crucial low-energy regime below 2.2 MeV, with potential to provide key insights into the carbon fusion process at stellar energies.
