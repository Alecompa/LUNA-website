## Overview

The $^{24}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{25}$Al reaction (Q = 2271.37 keV) is relevant in the context of the **MgAl cycle** which activates during H burning for T ≥ 80 MK.

While this reaction provides only a minor contribution to the stellar energy budget, it is a key process affecting the abundances of Mg and Al isotopes in Globular Cluster stars.

## Astrophysical Significance

### Globular Cluster Abundances

Spectroscopic analyses of different stars in the same cluster have revealed a **Mg–Al anti-correlation** similar to the widespread O-Na anti-correlation. This unique abundance pattern is commonly interpreted as the result of the CNO, NeNa and MgAl cycles operating in stars from early cluster formation epochs.

### Stardust Signatures

Stardust grains that formed around AGB stars carry the signature of H burning at high temperatures, including indication of partial activation of the MgAl cycle in the form of **enhanced $^{26}$Al production** by $^{24}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{25}$Al.

## Current Knowledge

Experimental knowledge on this reaction is mostly based on comprehensive cross section measurements at $E_{lab}$ < 2.3 MeV. Recent work at TUNL and LUNA focused on the lowest energy resonances only.

### Rate Determining Factors

At temperatures relevant for hydrogen shell burning:
- The reaction rate is **dominated by a direct capture (DC) component**
- A resonance at $E_{lab}$ = 222.9 keV dominates at higher temperatures
- Minor contribution from the low energy tail of the broad resonance at $E_{lab}$ = 823.3 keV

### Current Uncertainties

The uncertainty is dominated by:
- Limited knowledge of the DC component
- Strong interference between DC and higher energy resonances
- Discrepancies in the $E_{lab}$ = 222.9 keV resonance strength ωγ

## LUNA Measurement Strategy

The LUNA400 accelerator can produce proton beams with $E_p$ ≤ 400 keV, allowing exploration of the crucial low energy region.

### Key Technical Features

1. **Enriched solid targets**: Mandatory to avoid beam-induced background from overwhelmingly strong resonances in $^{25}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Al and $^{26}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{27}$Al at $E_p$ = 316 and 338 keV

2. **High-efficiency BGO detector**: Segmented for discrimination between signal and background events

3. **Direct DC measurement**: First direct measurement of the DC component below 400 keV

## Goals

- Resolve systematic offsets in previous measurements
- Directly measure the DC cross section at low energies
- Improve constraints on the MgAl cycle operation
- Refine stellar abundance predictions for Globular Clusters
