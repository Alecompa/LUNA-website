# **The Quantum Entanglement Equation**

In quantum physics, one of the most fundamental equations is:

$$
E = \hbar \omega
$$

Where:
- $E$ is the energy of the quantum system
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency

## **Applications in Entanglement**

Quantum entanglement relies heavily on this equation...
